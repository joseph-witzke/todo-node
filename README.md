# todo-node

Simple todo app using Node.js, Express, EJS. It was fun to learn about templates and how they can be effective for maximizing DRY code. Also added a MongoDB to persit data.

## To create custom todo lists:
Choose the name for your custom list and add it to the end of the URL -- e.g. http://localhost:3000//{work}
The title for your list will dynamical change to whatever name you provide in the URL. You can then switch freely between the lists you've created. 

## Future Improvements:
1. Navigation bar for adding/managing lists
2. Refactor to clean up the App.js file
3. Include testing
